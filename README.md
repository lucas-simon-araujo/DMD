**DMD - Dynamic Mode Decomposition code** is an ensemble of codes for computing the dynamic mode decomposition from complex systems data. It comprises codes to generate dynamical fields based on optimization benchmark test functions, evaluate the system's dynamical modes, reconstruct the original fields, predict their behavior in the next instants, and even a tool to obtain a similarity analysis for verifying the truncation influence in the well reconstruction of the fields.

## Documentation

**DMD** codes are all commented on, explaining their capabilities and construction steps. A list of inputs and outputs is also presented at the beginning of each file.

## Reproducibility

Simulations done with **DMD** are fully reproducible, as can be seen on this <a href="https://codeocean.com/capsule/4891890/tree/v1" target="_blank">CodeOcean capsule</a>
